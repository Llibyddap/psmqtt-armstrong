entry into crontab noting user exeuction.  

   10 0  *  *  * pi	/usr/bin/systemctl restart systemstransmitter.sh  # restarts mqtt every night at 10 past midnight.
  */5 *  *  *  * pi /home/pi/systemstransmitter.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 # ensures that mqtt is running, checks every 5 minutes.
  
  The '>/dev/null 2>&1' is a simple redirect of the output of the stout and the sterr to the null file (trash).
  
  I also tried working with 
  
  pgrep -f psmqtt.py || python /home/pi/psmqtt/psmqtt.py
  
  but found that the stability was an issue.
